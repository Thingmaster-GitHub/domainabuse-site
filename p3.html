      <h4 class="heading">DNS</h4>
      <p>The internet is a very, large, complicated system.Connecting all computers on the internet Directly would be expensive and impractical, so that is not how it works. Instead of doing this impossible task, it uses <span class="bold">DNS</span>. DNS stands for <span class="bold">Domain Name System</span>. this system allows URLS to be exchanged for the IP adress that leads to the server that you are trying to connect to. It has many redundant servers so that it if one server breaks it does not all go down with it, making the system <span class="bold">fault tolerant</span>. these many DNS servers are very <span class="bold">scalable</span> with different top level domans represented by different servers allowing for many different domains to be represented. these top level domains have a root domain located before them, allowing for even more variation. The number of these redundant servers make the system very <span class="bold">reliable</span>.</p>

      <h4 class="heading">Wider internet</h4>
      <p>The wider internet aside from <span class="bold">DNS</span> also has simalar systems in place. There are many different routes, or <span class="bold">paths</span> that your connection can make when conecting to a server.The packets,small collections of information, are routed by a <span class="bold">router</span> to a server which sends back a response depending on the information sent. The rate of sending and recieving packets varies, this is called the <span class="bold">bandwidth</span> or <span class="bold">bit rate</span>. It is affected by the path that the information may take as well as the speed that your network is capable of handling. a simaler thing to this is called <span class="bold">latency</span> which is the amount of time that it takes to send and recieve packets</p>

      <h4 class="heading">Conclusion</h4>
      <p>Essintially, all of these complicated systems are <span class="bold">computer networks</span> with many connected devices and a lot of redundant systems all working together to do various things like displaying sites like this one. </p>
